    Load and Visualize the MNIST Dataset
    To get started, you can load and visualize the dataset using this code snippet in Python:
    fromkeras.datasets import mnist
    frommatplotlib import pyplot
    # load dataset
    (trainX, trainy), (testX, testy) = mnist.load_data()
    # summarize loaded dataset
    print('Train: X=%s, y=%s' % (trainX.shape, trainy.shape))
    print('Test: X=%s, y=%s' % (testX.shape, testy.shape))
    # plot first few images
    fori in range(9):
        # define subplot
        pyplot.subplot(330 + 1 + i)
        # plot raw pixel data
        pyplot.imshow(trainX[i], cmap=pyplot.get_cmap('gray'))
    # show the figure
    pyplot.show()

    Once you have made your predictions using the test split of the MNIST dataset, you are required to test the accuracy of your model on real-world data. 
    In order to achieve this task, you are required to:
    •	Make your own handwritten digits from 0-9 using paint or any other online tool available. 
    •	Use different brush strokes of different sizes to diversify your test data.
    •	Load these images as a dataset into your Python notebook. 
    •	Convert these images into grayscale as well as resize them to 28 by 28 dimensions using Python (Use any Python library like OpenCV, PIL, or scikit-image). 
    •	Provide these images to your trained digit classifier. 
    •	Observe the model predictions.

The general formula for multiple linear regression outcomes is as follows:

![plot](https://github.com/fazeelkhalid/artificial-intelligence-lab/blob/main/Lab11/1.png)

•	β0 is known as the intercept.
•	β0 to βi are known as coefficients.
•	x1 to xi are the features of the data set.
•	ε are the residual terms.

We can also represent the formula in vector notation

![plot](https://github.com/fazeelkhalid/artificial-intelligence-lab/blob/main/Lab11/2.png)

The output equation would look like:

![plot](https://github.com/fazeelkhalid/artificial-intelligence-lab/blob/main/Lab11/3.png)

To find the coefficient values, we use the ordinary least square method which minimizes the sum of the square of the residuals. The formula for resulting coefficients in vector notation is:

![plot](https://github.com/fazeelkhalid/artificial-intelligence-lab/blob/main/Lab11/4.png)


The derivation of this formula is out of the scope of this lab.If you want to learn, read more about it here: https://web.stanford.edu/~mrosenfe/soc_meth_proj3/matrix_OLS_NYU_notes.pdf

The outcome of the algorithm, beta β with a hat (^) on top, is a vector containing all of the coefficients that can be used to make predictions by using the formula presented in the beginning for multiple linear regression.

Assuming that you have a number of predictions for some observed data, how can you measure how well the model predicted the ground truth? You can measure the accuracy of how well the multiple linear regression model performs by using a metric called r squared.

![plot](https://github.com/fazeelkhalid/artificial-intelligence-lab/blob/main/Lab11/5.png)


•	yi is one value of y at index i.
•	ŷ is pronounced as y hat and is the predicted values of y.
•	y̅ is pronounced as y bar and is the average of y.

The metric measures the relationship between the residual sum of squares (RSS) and the total sum of squares (TSS). The RSS is computed as the ground truth minus the predicted ground truth, while the TSS is computed as the ground truth minus the average of the ground truth.
